** 3 steps:
1. Choose credit card with annual fee only for specific category
   - write down annual fee
   - write down credits it gives you
   - look at cash back points or percents
2. Subtract credit by dining fee then divide by cash back credit percentage
   - 250 - 120 / .004 = 3,250
   - that big number is what you need to spend to make it worth it
