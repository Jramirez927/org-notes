Dear Hiring Team,

I’m excited to apply for the Full Stack Engineer I role at Cherokee Federal. Over the past several years, I’ve built and maintained full-stack applications for federal and DoD customers, working with React, TypeScript, Angular, .NET/EF Core, Python, SQL/PostgreSQL, and a variety of cloud-connected workflows. Much of my work has focused on designing user-facing features, developing secure backend logic, building RESTful APIs, and improving application performance for mission-driven systems.


Thank you for your time and consideration. I’d welcome the chance to contribute my full-stack development experience and federal project background to Cherokee Federal’s engineering team.

Sincerely,
Jorge Ramirez
