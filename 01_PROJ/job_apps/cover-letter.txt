COBEC (FAA)
=============

  Dear Hiring Team,

  I’m interested in the Mid-Level GIS Developer role with the FAA. I’ve
  spent the past several years building GIS applications for federal and
  DoD clients, working with the ArcGIS JS SDK, React, TypeScript, .NET
  APIs, and Python tools like ArcPy. My work at NV5 | AXIMGEO includes
  developing custom mapping features, creating Web AppBuilder widgets,
  publishing services on ArcGIS Enterprise, and supporting users who
  rely on accurate geospatial data every day.

  I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of GIS and software
  development, and I’m looking for a role where I can keep contributing
  to mission-focused geospatial tools. I’d welcome the chance to bring
  my experience to your team.

  Thank you for your time, Jorge Ramirez
