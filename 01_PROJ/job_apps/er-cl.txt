Cover Letter — Software Engineer | Elder Research

Dear Hiring Team,

I’m excited to apply for the Software Engineer role at Elder Research. I
bring hands-on experience building full-stack applications for federal
clients, working with React and Angular on the front end, .NET and
Python services on the back end, and SQL/PostgreSQL for data access. My
background includes developing REST APIs, supporting CI/CD pipelines
with Jenkins, containerizing services with Docker, and collaborating in
Agile DevOps teams to deliver secure, reliable solutions in AWS-based
environments. I’m a U.S. citizen with Public Trust eligibility and am
eager to continue growing as a full stack developer while contributing
to Elder Research mission-driven work.

Sincerely, Jorge Ramirez
